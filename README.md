2020-2021 Unemployment Analysis
I identified if there are any specific characteristics that are common for unemployed individuals in the USA from the years of 2020 and 2021 using data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (https://www.bls.gov/cps/tables.htm).  For example, are specific races or genders more likely to be unemployed.
